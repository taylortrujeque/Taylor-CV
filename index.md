# Welcome!
## Taylor Trujeque- PhD Candidate at the University of Central Florida 

### About Me
Hello! I’m Taylor Trujeque. I hold a Master of Arts in Film Studies from University College London, where I developed specialized expertise in film genres, theory, content, and form. My academic journey is currently continuing at the University of Central Florida, where I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Texts and Technology. This site showcases my ongoing research, teaching experience and philosophy, and scholarly work in film and media studies.

I recently started teaching at Flagler College as an Adjunct Professor, where I’ve cultivated a passion for teaching and scholarship. I have experience lecturing and guiding both self-directed and collaborative research. I am committed to advancing knowledge in the fields of cinema studies and technology while fostering inclusive, engaging learning environments. My work bridges critical analysis and creative inquiry, empowering students to explore media through a theoretical lens.

### Research Interests
My research interests center on the intersection of sound and cinema, with a particular focus on how auditory and visual elements converge to shape audience experience. I am interested in exploring the moment when a film score collides with the image on screen—transcending reality and evoking a euphoric frisson that immerses viewers in a heightened emotional state.

In addition, I explore gender studies in cinema, examining how the evolution of sound in American film has influenced the representation of women on screen. This line of inquiry considers how sonic techniques, from voice and music to ambient sound, have historically shaped, reinforced, or challenged gendered narratives.
