# Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching film history centers on bridging the past with the present. I recognize that the evolution of film technology can make it challenging for students to connect with early cinema. To overcome this, I emphasize how foundational techniques from early filmmaking continue to shape contemporary media. By tracing the lineage of cinematic styles and innovations, students gain a deeper appreciation for the films continuing transformation.

At the heart of my teaching philosophy is the belief in building meaningful connections-with both the material and the students themselves. I strive to create a classroom environment where students feel safe and encouraged to share their perspectives and insights about film and media. I aim to nurture their natural curiosity and guide them toward making more thoughtful, nuanced observations. Through this approach, I hope to inspire students to see film as a powerful cultural and artistic expression that evolves with time.
